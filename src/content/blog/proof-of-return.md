Last year, I quit my job and decided to travel through Latin America for 3
months. I booked a one-way ticket to Belize without any plans on where I'd end
up. Ready to start an amazing adventure.

That is, until I arrived to Atlanta for a layover. When my plane to Belize City
was ready and they started boarding, they called my name. "Could Mr. de Vries
please come to the gate counter?". I did, and they told me I wasn't allowed to
board. The reason being that I didn't have a _proof of return_. What's that now?

It turns out that if you don't have a return ticket, or proof that you'll be
leaving a country, some countries don't allow you in. In fact, the lady at the
airport told me they'd arrest me and put me in jail upon arrival! They would
only let me board if I had proof I'd be exiting the country. So 2 minutes before
closing the gate, I was forced to look up airline tickets online with airport
wifi and book a ticket from Belize City to another country.

I booked a flight from Belize City to Tulum, Mexico, showed it to the lady and
she finally let me board.

Guess what happened when I arrived in Belize, after 24 hours of traveling?
Nothing. Nobody asked me for a proof of return. Nobody arrested me. Nobody put
me in jail. What was all of this about?
